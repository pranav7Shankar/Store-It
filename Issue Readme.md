git One of the most challenging problems I solved recently involved diagnosing and improving the performance of a web application that had become noticeably slow during initial load. Instead of guessing, I performed a detailed analysis using Lighthouse, Chrome DevTools, and network profiling to trace the exact bottlenecks. I discovered that oversized images, unused dependencies, and multiple blocking JavaScript scripts were inflating bundle size and delaying rendering. To fix this, I introduced lazy loading, compressed assets, removed redundant libraries, and implemented route-based code splitting to reduce the amount of JS executed on the first paint. I also optimized component structure to eliminate unnecessary re-renders. These changes led to a significant reduction in load time and improved the Lighthouse performance score by over 25%. This experience strengthened my ability to break down ambiguous problems into measurable components and iterate toward scalable, data-driven solutions.
